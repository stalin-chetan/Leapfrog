<h4>Hi, I'm Chetan Thapa, a passionate Computer Engineering student at NCIT College. Iâ€™ve been fascinated by computers since a young age, which inspired me to pursue a career in technology. I specialize in frontend development and enjoy working with technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Flutter, and Java.
Currently, I'm deepening my skills by working on projects involving FastAPI for backend development and YOLOv8 for speed detection systems. Outside of coding, I enjoy video editing, traveling, and adventuring. I love turning creative ideas into interactive digital experiences and aim to collaborate with innovative frontend teams in the future.</h4>
